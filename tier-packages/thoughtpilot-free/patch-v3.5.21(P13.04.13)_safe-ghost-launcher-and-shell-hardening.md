# Patch Summary: safe-ghost-launcher-and-shell-hardening

**Patch ID:** patch-v3.5.21(P13.04.13)_safe-ghost-launcher-and-shell-hardening  
**Status:** ✅ PASS  
**Timestamp:** 2025-01-23 UTC  

## 🎯 Objective
Add hardened launcher scripts for MAIN and CYOPS systems with non-blocking shell wrappers to prevent system freezes from unsafe spawn/exec usage.

## 📋 Changes Applied

### ✅ Created Files
1. **`scripts/start-main.js`** - Hardened launcher for MAIN system
   - Uses `nohup` + `disown` + log redirection
   - Launches Expo and Backend with proper detachment
   - Includes health checks with curl and lsof

2. **`scripts/start-cyops.js`** - Hardened launcher for CYOPS system  
   - Uses `nohup` + `disown` + log redirection
   - Launches patch-executor and ghost-runner with proper detachment
   - Includes health check with curl

3. **`scripts/audit/unsafe-shell-scan.sh`** - Audit tool for unsafe patterns
   - Scans for `spawn`, `exec`, `execSync` usage
   - Excludes safe patterns (nohup, disown, safe, start-)
   - Provides clear output for review

### 🔍 Audit Results
The audit script identified **50+ unsafe shell patterns** across the project:
- Multiple `execSync` calls without proper error handling
- Direct `spawn` usage without detachment
- Blocking `exec` calls that could freeze the system
- Files affected: monitor scripts, validation scripts, daemon scripts, CLI tools

## 🛡️ Safety Improvements
- **Non-blocking execution**: All launcher scripts use `nohup` + `disown`
- **Log redirection**: All output routed to `logs/*.log` files
- **Health monitoring**: Built-in curl/lsof checks for process validation
- **Audit capability**: Tool to identify unsafe patterns for future hardening

## 📊 Validation Status
- ✅ Launcher scripts created with proper hardening
- ✅ Audit tool executable and functional
- ✅ Directory structure created (`logs/`, `scripts/audit/`)
- ✅ Non-blocking patterns implemented

## 🚨 Critical Findings
The audit revealed extensive unsafe shell usage throughout the codebase:
- **50+ instances** of potentially blocking shell calls
- **Multiple daemon scripts** using unsafe spawn/exec patterns
- **Monitor scripts** with blocking process checks
- **CLI tools** with synchronous execution

## 📝 Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Use the new hardened launcher scripts for system startup
2. **Short-term**: Review and fix the 50+ unsafe patterns identified by audit
3. **Long-term**: Implement comprehensive shell hardening across all scripts
