# Summary: patch-v3.3.26(P14.01.01)_tunnel-watchdog-daemon-injection

**Timestamp**: 2025-07-24T18:15:00.000Z  
**Agent**: GPT  
**Status**: ✅ PATCH EXECUTION COMPLETE  

## Patch Overview
Successfully injected persistent tunnel health watchdog into CYOPS/MAIN lifecycle with auto-restart functionality for downed tunnels.

## Key Achievements

### ✅ Tunnel Watchdog Deployed
- **Auto-Detection**: Monitors cloudflared and ngrok processes continuously
- **Safe Restart**: Implements timeout protection and background execution
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All actions logged to dedicated `watchdog-tunnel.log`
- **Failsafe Protection**: Prevents respawn loops with sleep intervals

### ✅ Integration Complete
- **Launch Sequence**: Injected into `launch-all-systems.sh` for automatic startup
- **Daemon Manager**: Integrated into `daemon-manager.sh` for persistent monitoring
- **Process Verification**: Confirmed watchdog running with multiple PIDs (41042, 41073)

### ✅ Auto-Restart Verified
- **Cloudflared Detection**: Successfully detected and restarted cloudflared
- **Process Confirmation**: Cloudflared now running (PID: 43559)
- **Log Validation**: Both cloudflared and ngrok patterns found in logs

## Technical Implementation

### Watchdog Features
- Continuous monitoring with 45-second intervals
- 30-second timeout protection on restart commands
- Background execution with proper disown patterns
- 2-second sleep between restarts to prevent loops

### Safety Mechanisms
- All processes properly disowned to prevent terminal blocking
- Error handling for missing tunnel scripts
- Comprehensive logging for audit trail
- Failsafe protection against infinite restart loops

## Compliance Status
- ✅ All patch requirements met
- ✅ Non-blocking terminal patterns enforced
- ✅ Summary file created and committed
- ✅ Git commit and tag applied successfully

## Final Status
**PATCH EXECUTION SUCCESSFUL**: Tunnel watchdog injected and operational. Auto-restart functionality verified and logging active.
