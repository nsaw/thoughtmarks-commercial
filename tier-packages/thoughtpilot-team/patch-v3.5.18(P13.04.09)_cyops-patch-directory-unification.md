# Patch Summary: patch-v3.5.18(P13.04.09)_cyops-patch-directory-unification

**Patch ID:** patch-v3.5.18(P13.04.09)_cyops-patch-directory-unification  
**Description:** Fix CYOPS patch directory paths and unify runner/executor directories  
**Target:** DEV  
**Status:** ✅ PASS  

## Overview
Fixed critical path inconsistencies in the CYOPS system that were preventing proper patch detection and execution. Unified all patch-related components to use the same directory structure.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. **Incorrect Patch Directory Paths**
- **Problem:** Monitor was using wrong paths for CYOPS patches
- **Solution:** Updated monitor to use correct absolute paths
- **Before:** `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/CYOPS/patches`
- **After:** `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/.cursor-cache/CYOPS/patches`

### 2. **Patch Executor Directory Mismatch**
- **Problem:** Executor was using `tasks/queue` instead of unified patch directory
- **Solution:** Updated executor to use `.cursor-cache/CYOPS/patches`
- **Added:** Automatic patch movement to `.completed` and `.failed` directories

### 3. **Monitor Status Update Issue**
- **Problem:** Agent format wasn't calling `updateStatus()` before display
- **Solution:** Added `updateStatus()` call to `getStatusForAgent()` method

## Files Modified

### 1. **Monitor Script**
- **File:** `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/scripts/monitor/real-dual_monitor.js`
- **Changes:**
  - Fixed CYOPS patches path to use correct absolute path
  - Added `updateStatus()` call to agent format method
  - Enhanced error reporting for debugging

### 2. **Patch Executor**
- **File:** `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/scripts/patch-executor.js`
- **Changes:**
  - Updated to use unified patch directory: `.cursor-cache/CYOPS/patches`
  - Added automatic patch movement to `.completed` directory on success
  - Added automatic patch movement to `.failed` directory on error
  - Fixed variable scope issues in try-catch blocks

## Directory Structure Now Unified

```
/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/.cursor-cache/CYOPS/
├── patches/
│   ├── .completed/          # Successfully processed patches
│   ├── .failed/            # Failed patches
│   ├── .archive/           # Archived patches
│   └── *.json              # Pending patches
└── summaries/              # Summary files (in main .cursor-cache/CYOPS/)

/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/CYOPS/
└── summaries/              # Summary files for CYOPS system
```

## Validation Results

### ✅ **Monitor Functionality**
- **Before:** CYOPS showed 0 pending patches (incorrect)
- **After:** CYOPS correctly detects pending patches
- **Test:** Created test patch, verified detection, processed successfully

### ✅ **Patch Executor Functionality**
- **Before:** Used `tasks/queue` directory
- **After:** Uses unified `.cursor-cache/CYOPS/patches` directory
- **Test:** Successfully processed test patch and moved to `.completed`

### ✅ **System Integration**
- **Monitor:** Correctly reads from unified patch directory
- **Executor:** Writes to same unified patch directory
- **Orchestrator:** Already configured for correct paths
- **Status:** All components now use consistent directory structure

## Commands Tested

```bash
# Monitor shows correct status
node scripts/monitor/real-dual_monitor.js agent

# Executor processes patches correctly
node scripts/patch-executor.js

# Directory structure verified
ls -la .cursor-cache/CYOPS/patches/
ls -la .cursor-cache/CYOPS/patches/.completed/
```

## Impact

- **Reliability:** Eliminates path inconsistencies that caused patch detection failures
- **Maintainability:** Single source of truth for patch directory locations
- **Monitoring:** Real-time accurate status reporting for both MAIN and CYOPS systems
- **Execution:** Seamless patch processing with proper file organization

## Next Steps

1. **Mirror Setup:** Ensure patch directory is properly mirrored to main cursor-cache
2. **Testing:** Run full system tests with real patches
3. **Documentation:** Update any remaining documentation with correct paths
4. **Monitoring:** Verify long-term stability of unified directory structure
