**Patch ID:** patch-v3.5.16(P13.04.07)_ghost-dual-status-monitor  
**Description:** Create dual-project status monitor script for Ghost overview panel  
**Target:** DEV  
**Status:** ✅ PASS  

## Overview
Created a comprehensive dual-system status monitor that shows both MAIN and CYOPS system status in a unified view, following the exact format of the existing dual-view-monitor.js.

## Implementation Details

### File Created
- **Path:** `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/scripts/monitor/real-dual_monitor.js`
- **Size:** 15KB, 450+ lines
- **Executable:** ✅ Yes

### Key Features
1. **Dual System Monitoring:** Monitors both MAIN and CYOPS systems simultaneously
2. **Unified Display Format:** Matches the existing dual-view-monitor.js format exactly
3. **Real-time Updates:** 5-second refresh intervals with file watchers
4. **System-specific Checks:** Different process monitoring for each system
5. **Agent Chat Format:** Dedicated `agent` command for formatted output

### System Configurations
- **MAIN System:**
  - Root: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/tm-mobile-cursor`
  - Patches: `mobile-native-fresh/src-nextgen/patches`
  - Summaries: `.cursor-cache/MAIN/summaries`
  - Ghost URL: `https://runner.thoughtmarks.app/health`

- **CYOPS System:**
  - Root: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner`
  - Patches: `src-nextgen/patches`
  - Summaries: `.cursor-cache/CYOPS/summaries`
  - Ghost URL: `https://gpt-cursor-runner.fly.dev/health`

### Display Format
The monitor shows:
- **Patch Status:** Pending, executing, completed, failed for both systems
- **Execution Queue:** Current queue status for each system
- **System Status:** Running/stopped processes for each system
- **Ghost Runner Status:** Health status for both ghost endpoints
- **Recent Activity:** Last 3 summary files for each system

### CLI Commands
- `start` - Start monitoring both systems
- `stop` - Stop monitoring
- `execute` - Execute pending patches for both systems
- `status` - Show current status once
- `agent` - Show formatted status for agent chat

## Validation Results

### ✅ File Creation
- Script created successfully at specified path
- Executable permissions set correctly

### ✅ Functionality Test
- Agent format output working correctly
- Shows both MAIN and CYOPS status
- Displays recent activity for both systems
- Handles missing directories gracefully

### ✅ Format Compliance
- Matches existing dual-view-monitor.js format exactly
- Uses same filename concatenation utility
- Consistent emoji and formatting

### ✅ System Integration
- Uses absolute paths as required
- Integrates with existing filename-concatenator utility
- Follows non-blocking terminal patterns

## Usage Example

```bash
# Show agent-formatted status
node scripts/monitor/real-dual_monitor.js agent

# Start live monitoring
node scripts/monitor/real-dual_monitor.js start

# Execute patches for both systems
node scripts/monitor/real-dual_monitor.js execute
```
