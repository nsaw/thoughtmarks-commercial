# Summary: patch-v3.3.28(P14.01.03)_patch-queue-stall-validator-daemon

**Timestamp**: 2025-07-24T18:25:00.000Z  
**Agent**: GPT  
**Status**: ✅ PATCH EXECUTION COMPLETE  

## Patch Overview
Successfully injected daemon to validate patch queues in MAIN/CYOPS and alert on silent execution stalls.

## Key Achievements

### ✅ Patch Queue Validator Deployed
- **Queue Health Monitoring**: Checks patch files in `/tasks/patches` directory
- **Summary Activity Tracking**: Monitors recent summary file timestamps
- **Stale Patch Detection**: Identifies patches older than 15 minutes
- **Summary Stall Detection**: Alerts when no new summary written in 10+ minutes
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Runs checks every 60 seconds

### ✅ Stall Prevention Infrastructure
- **Silent Stall Detection**: Prevents patches from stalling silently in queue
- **Cross-Validation**: Compares summaries vs pending patches
- **Timestamp Analysis**: Monitors file modification times for queue health
- **Warning System**: Logs alerts for queue stalls and summary inactivity

### ✅ Integration Complete
- **Launch Sequence**: Injected into `launch-all-systems.sh` for automatic startup
- **Process Verification**: Confirmed validator running with multiple PIDs (23899, 23921)
- **Log Management**: Output directed to dedicated `watchdog-patch-queue.log` file

## Technical Implementation

### Validator Features
- Continuous monitoring with 60-second intervals
- File system safe operations using Node.js `fs` module
- 30-second timeout protection on script execution
- Background execution with proper disown patterns
- Comprehensive logging for audit trail

### Monitoring Logic
- **Patch Queue Check**: Scans for `.json` files in `/tasks/patches`
- **Summary Check**: Scans for `.md` files in `/summaries`
- **Timestamp Analysis**: Compares file modification times against current time
- **Warning Generation**: Logs warnings for stale patches and summary inactivity

### Safety Mechanisms
- All processes properly disowned to prevent terminal blocking
- Error handling for missing directories or files
- Comprehensive logging for audit trail
- Non-blocking background execution

## Validation Results

### Queue Health Status
```
✅ No stale patches detected
✅ Recent summary activity confirmed
✅ Queue validator operational
```

### Log Pattern Confirmation
```
[INFO] No stall warnings yet — valid startup
Log file exists and is not empty
```

### Process Verification
```
✅ Patch queue validator running (PIDs: 23899, 23921)
✅ Log file created and contains content
✅ No stall warnings detected (valid startup state)
```

## Compliance Status
- ✅ All patch requirements met
- ✅ Non-blocking terminal patterns enforced
- ✅ Summary file created and committed
- ✅ Git commit and tag applied successfully

## Final Status
**PATCH EXECUTION SUCCESSFUL**: Patch queue validator injected and operational. Queue stall detection active and logging functional.
