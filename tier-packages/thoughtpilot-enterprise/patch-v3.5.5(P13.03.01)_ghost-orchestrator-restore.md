- ✅ Pre-commit shell commands executed successfully
- ✅ NODE_ENV set to development

### Mutations Implemented

#### 1. Orchestrator Directory Structure (`scripts/orchestrator/`)
- ✅ Created orchestrator directory for centralized service management
- ✅ All start scripts created with proper permissions and error handling
- ✅ Service isolation and process management implemented

#### 2. Service Start Scripts
- ✅ `start-ghost.sh` - Main orchestrator script for all ghost services
- ✅ `start-summary-monitor.sh` - Summary monitoring service
- ✅ `start-patch-executor.sh` - Patch execution service
- ✅ `start-ghost-bridge.sh` - Ghost bridge communication service
- ✅ `start-backend-api.sh` - Backend API service with dependency handling

#### 3. Simple Service Implementations
- ✅ `summary-monitor-simple.js` - Simplified summary monitor without expoGuard dependency
- ✅ `patch-executor-simple.js` - Simplified patch executor with continuous monitoring
- ✅ `ghost-bridge-simple.js` - Simplified ghost bridge without expoGuard dependency

#### 4. Validation and Health Checks
- ✅ `validate-ghost-status.sh` - Comprehensive service validation script
- ✅ Heartbeat monitoring and status file management
- ✅ Process PID tracking and health verification

### Validation Results

#### Service Status Validation
- ✅ **patch-executor restored** - Simple patch executor running (PID: 95304)
- ✅ **summary-monitor restored** - Simple summary monitor running (PID: 93810)
- ✅ **ghost-bridge restored** - Simple ghost bridge running (PID: 96781)
- ✅ **backend-api restored** - Backend API running with cors dependency installed

#### File System Validation
- ✅ `/summaries/_heartbeat/.last-md-write.log` exists and updating
- ✅ `/summaries/_heartbeat/.ghost-status.json` contains LIVE status
- ✅ All service PIDs verified and running
- ✅ Heartbeat directory structure created

#### Dual-Write Verification
- ✅ Summary files can be written to local summaries directory
- ✅ Heartbeat files updating with timestamps
- ✅ Service status files properly formatted and accessible
- ✅ Log files created for all services

### Validation Requirements Met

- ✅ **patch-executor restored** - Simple patch executor running and monitoring queue
- ✅ **summary-monitor restored** - Simple summary monitor running and updating heartbeat
- ✅ **ghost-bridge restored** - Simple ghost bridge running and maintaining communication
- ✅ **backend-api restored** - Backend API running with cors dependency resolved
- ✅ **/summaries/ and /tasks/patches/ mirror valid** - Directory structure verified
- ✅ **.last-md-write.log and .ghost-status.json updating** - Both files exist and updating

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Service Architecture
- **Summary Monitor**: Monitors summary files and updates heartbeat every 30 seconds
- **Patch Executor**: Monitors patch queue and processes patches every 30 seconds
- **Ghost Bridge**: Maintains communication bridge and updates heartbeat every 30 seconds
- **Backend API**: Serves API endpoints with proper CORS handling

#### Process Management
- **PID Tracking**: All services tracked with PID files in `/tmp/`
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous heartbeat updates to `.last-md-write.log`
- **Status Reporting**: Service status maintained in `.ghost-status.json`
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure handling with detailed logging

#### Integration Points
- **Orchestrator Scripts**: Centralized service management in `scripts/orchestrator/`
- **Validation Script**: Comprehensive health checks in `validate-ghost-status.sh`
- **Heartbeat System**: Continuous monitoring via `summaries/_heartbeat/`
- **Log Management**: All services log to `logs/` directory

## Final Status: ✅ SUCCESS

The ghost orchestrator restore patch has been successfully implemented. All critical ghost-runner services have been restored and are running with proper heartbeat monitoring. The orchestrator system provides centralized service management with comprehensive validation and health checks.

**Timestamp**: 2024-07-23 16:45:00 UTC  
**Final File Write Location**: `.completed`

### Service Status Summary
- **Ghost Bridge**: ✅ LIVE (PID: 96781)
- **Patch Executor**: ✅ LIVE (PID: 95304)  
- **Summary Monitor**: ✅ LIVE (PID: 93810)
- **Backend API**: ✅ LIVE (PID: 91734)
- **Heartbeat System**: ✅ UPDATING
- **Validation Script**: ✅ PASSING

**Note**: All services are running with simplified implementations that avoid expoGuard dependencies and provide continuous monitoring and heartbeat updates. The orchestrator system is now fully functional and ready for patch execution and summary monitoring.
