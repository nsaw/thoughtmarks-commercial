## Functionality Improvements

### Consolidated Commands
- **`/proceed`**: Handles approve-screenshot, continue-runner, and resume-runner functionality
- **`/again`**: Handles retry-last-failed and restart-runner functionality

### Manual Override Commands
- **`/manual-revise`**: Allows manual revision of GPT patches with custom instructions
- **`/manual-append`**: Allows manual addition of content to patches
- **`/interrupt`**: Provides immediate interruption capabilities

### Automated Troubleshooting
- **`/troubleshoot`**: Automated diagnostics and fixes
- **`/troubleshoot-oversight`**: Manual oversight after automated troubleshooting

### AI Workflow Enhancement
- **`/send-with`**: Prompts GPT or Cursor to resend with logs, context, console

## Usage Examples

### Consolidated Commands
```
/proceed          # Auto-detect: approve screenshot, continue runner, or approve patch
/proceed screenshot  # Explicitly approve screenshot
/proceed continue    # Explicitly continue runner
/again             # Auto-detect: retry failed or restart runner
/again retry       # Explicitly retry failed operation
/again restart     # Explicitly restart runner
```

### Manual Override Commands
```
/manual-revise "Fix the button styling to use primary colors"
/manual-append "Add error handling for edge cases"
/interrupt        # Graceful interruption
/interrupt pause  # Pause operations
/interrupt force  # Force stop all operations
```

### Troubleshooting Commands
```
/troubleshoot     # Auto-fix mode
/troubleshoot fix # Explicit auto-fix
/troubleshoot-oversight approve  # Approve automated fixes
/troubleshoot-oversight reject   # Reject and rollback fixes
```

### AI Enhancement Commands
```
/send-with logs    # Request AI to resend with logs
/send-with context # Request AI to resend with context
/send-with console # Request AI to resend with console output
/send-with all     # Request AI to resend with all context
```

## Security Considerations
- All dynamic command inputs are validated for passthrough security
- Manual override commands require minimum character limits
- Troubleshooting commands include oversight mechanisms
- Archived handlers preserved in `server/commands/archived/`

## Migration Notes
- Old command handlers moved to `server/commands/archived/`
- New consolidated handlers provide backward compatibility
- Usage hints updated for Slack-friendly format
- All commands pass linting and manifest character limits
