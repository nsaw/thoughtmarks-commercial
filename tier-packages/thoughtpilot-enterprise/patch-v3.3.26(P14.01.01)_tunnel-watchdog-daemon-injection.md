# Patch Summary: patch-v3.3.26(P14.01.01)_tunnel-watchdog-daemon-injection

**Patch ID**: patch-v3.3.26(P14.01.01)_tunnel-watchdog-daemon-injection  
**Patch Name**: patch-v3.3.26(P14.01.01)_tunnel-watchdog-daemon-injection  
**Roadmap Phase**: P14.01.01 - Tunnel watchdog daemon injection  
**Target**: DEV  
**Status**: ✅ PASS  

## Patch Description
Inject tunnel watchdog daemon to auto-restart downed tunnels and bind to start sequence.

## Execution Summary

### ✅ Pre-Commit Actions
- **Backup Created**: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/_backups/20250724_UTC_v3.3.26_tunnel-watchdog-daemon-injection_backup_tm-mobile-cursor.tar.gz`
- **Script Permissions**: Made tunnel watchdog script executable

### ✅ Mutations Applied
- **`scripts/watchdogs/tunnel-watchdog.sh`**: Created new tunnel watchdog script
  - Auto-detects downed cloudflared/ngrok tunnels
  - Implements safe restart with timeout and disown
  - Logs all restart actions to `logs/watchdog-tunnel.log`
  - Runs continuous monitoring with 45-second intervals
- **`scripts/launch-all-systems.sh`**: Updated to use new tunnel watchdog path
- **`scripts/watchdog/daemon-manager.sh`**: Injected tunnel watchdog into daemon manager

### ✅ Post-Mutation Build Validation
All validation commands executed successfully:
- ✅ Tunnel watchdog script exists and is executable
- ✅ Script runs successfully with timeout protection
- ✅ Process verification confirms watchdog is running (PIDs: 41042, 41073)

### ✅ Runtime Validation
- ✅ **Cloudflared Detection**: `grep -q cloudflared logs/watchdog-tunnel.log` - PASS
- ✅ **Ngrok Detection**: `grep -q ngrok logs/watchdog-tunnel.log` - PASS
- ✅ **Auto-Restart**: Cloudflared process confirmed running (PID: 43559)

## Technical Implementation

### Tunnel Watchdog Features
- **Auto-Detection**: Monitors cloudflared and ngrok processes using `pgrep`
- **Safe Restart**: Uses `timeout 30s` to prevent hanging processes
- **Background Execution**: All restarts use `& disown` for non-blocking operation
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All actions logged to `logs/watchdog-tunnel.log`
- **Failsafe Protection**: 2-second sleep between restarts to prevent respawn loops

### Integration Points
- **Launch Sequence**: Injected into `launch-all-systems.sh` for automatic startup
- **Daemon Manager**: Integrated into `daemon-manager.sh` for persistent monitoring
- **Log Management**: Output directed to dedicated `watchdog-tunnel.log` file

### Safety Mechanisms
- **Timeout Protection**: 30-second timeout on all tunnel restart commands
- **Process Disowning**: All background processes properly disowned
- **Sleep Intervals**: 45-second monitoring intervals with 2-second restart delays
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing tunnel scripts

## Validation Results

### Process Verification
```
✅ Tunnel watchdog running (PIDs: 41042, 41073)
✅ Cloudflared process active (PID: 43559)
✅ Log file created and growing (2.2MB+)
```

### Log Pattern Confirmation
```
✅ cloudflared found in log
✅ ngrok found in log
```

### Auto-Restart Verification
The tunnel watchdog successfully detected and restarted cloudflared:
- Detected cloudflared was not running
- Executed restart command with timeout protection
- Cloudflared process now active and running

## Compliance Verification

### Patch Requirements Met
- ✅ `enforceValidationGate: true`
- ✅ `strictRuntimeAudit: true`
- ✅ `runDryCheck: true`
- ✅ `forceRuntimeTrace: true`
- ✅ `requireMutationProof: true`
- ✅ `requireServiceUptime: true`
- ✅ `blockCommitOnError: true`
- ✅ `watchConsole: true`

### Non-Blocking Patterns
- ✅ All shell commands use `{ command & } >/dev/null 2>&1 & disown`
- ✅ Background processes properly disowned
- ✅ No terminal blocking observed
- ✅ Cursor UI remains responsive

## Final Status
**PATCH EXECUTION SUCCESSFUL**: Tunnel watchdog injected and operational. Auto-restart functionality verified and logging active.
